# Install Jenkins on AWS EC2
Jenkins is a self-contained Java-based program, ready to run out-of-the-box, with packages for Windows, Mac OS X and other Unix-like operating systems. As an extensible automation server, Jenkins can be used as a simple CI server or turned into the continuous delivery hub for any project.


### Prerequisites
1. EC2 Instance 
   - With Internet Access
   - Security Group with Port `8080` open for internet
1. Java v1.8.x 

## Install Java
1. We will be using open java for our demo, Get the latest version from http://openjdk.java.net/install/
   ```sh
   yum install java-1.8*
   #yum -y install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel
   ```

1. Confirm Java Version and set the java home
   ```sh
   java -version
   find /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8* | head -n 3
   JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-<Java version which seen in the above output>
   export JAVA_HOME
   PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME
    # To set it permanently update your .bash_profile
   vi ~/.bash_profile
   ```
   _The output should be something like this,_
    ```sh
   [root@~]# java -version
   openjdk version "1.8.0_151"
   OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_151-b12)
   OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.151-b12, mixed mode)
   ```

## Install Jenkins
 You can install jenkins using the rpm or by setting up the repo. We will set up the repo so that we can update it easily in the future.
1. Get the latest version of jenkins from https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/ and install
   ```sh
   yum -y install wget
   sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
   sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io.key
   yum -y install jenkins
   ```

   ### Start Jenkins
   ```sh
   # Start jenkins service
   service jenkins start

   # Setup Jenkins to start at boot,
   chkconfig jenkins on
   ```

   ### Accessing Jenkins
   By default jenkins runs at port `8080`, You can access jenkins at
   ```sh
   http://YOUR-SERVER-PUBLIC-IP:8080
   ```
  #### Configure Jenkins
- The default Username is `admin`
- Grab the default password 
- Password Location:`/var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword`
- `Skip` Plugin Installation; _We can do it later_
- Change admin password
   - `Admin` > `Configure` > `Password`
- Configure `java` path
  - `Manage Jenkins` > `Global Tool Configuration` > `JDK`  
- Create another admin user id

# Configure Git pulgin on Jenkins
Git is one of the most popular tools for version control system. you can pull code from git repositories using jenkins if you use github plugin. 


#### Prerequisites
1. Jenkins server 

#### Install Git on Jenkins server
1. Install git packages on jenkins server
   ```sh
   yum install git -y
   ```

#### Setup Git on jenkins console
- Install git plugin without restart  
  - `Manage Jenkins` > `Jenkins Plugins` > `available` > `github`

- Configure git path
  - `Manage Jenkins` > `Global Tool Configuration` > `git`

# Ansible Installation

Ansible is an open-source automation platform. It is very, very simple to set up and yet powerful. Ansible can help you with configuration management, application deployment, task automation.

### Pre-requisites

1. An AWS EC2 instance (on Control node)

### Installation steps:
#### on Amazon EC2 instance

1. Install python and python-pip
   ```sh
   yum install python
   yum install python-pip
   ```
1. Install ansible using pip check for version
    ```sh
    pip install ansible
   ansible --version
   ```
   
1. Create a user called ansadmin (on Control node and Managed host)  
   ```sh
   useradd ansadmin
   passwd ansadmin
   ```
1. Below command grant sudo access to ansadmin user. But we strongly recommended using "visudo" command if you are aware vi or nano editor.  (on Control node and Managed host)
   ```sh
   echo "ansadmin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" >> /etc/sudoers
   ```
   
1. Log in as a ansadmin user on master and generate ssh key (on Control node)
   ```sh 
   sudo su - ansadmin
   ssh-keygen
   ```
1. Copy keys onto all ansible managed hosts (on Control node)
   ```sh 
   ssh-copy-id ansadmin@<target-server>
   ```

1. Ansible server used to create images and store on docker registry. Hence install docker, start docker services and add ansadmin to the docker group. 
   ```sh
   yum install docker
   
   # start docker services 
   service docker start
   service docker start 
   
   # add user to docker group 
   usermod -aG docker ansadmin

   ```
1. Create a directory /etc/ansible and create an inventory file called "hosts" add control node and managed hosts IP addresses to it. 
 
### Validation test

   
1. Run ansible command as ansadmin user it should be successful (Master)
   ```sh 
   ansible all -m ping
   ```
